<!-- ## Whiteboard Process
![alt text](./Whiteboard27.jpg) -->

## Approach & Efficiency

create two funcitons that sorts a list of movies either by title or by year

## Solution

### after defining resolving some issues in the pseudo code:
sort_by_year:

    the Time Complexity is = O(n log n)
    the Space Complexity is = O(n)

sort_by_title:

    the Time Complexity is = O(n log n)
    the Space Complexity is = O(n)
