## Challenge Title
Tree-intersection challenge

## Whiteboard Process
![alt text](./Whiteboard32.jpg)

## Approach & Efficiency

create a hastable function that is similar to the hashmap and to check for commons in two binary trees

## Solution

### after defining the initial code:
tree_intersection:
    the Time Complexity is = O(n)
    the Space Complexity is = O(k)
