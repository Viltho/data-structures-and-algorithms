# Code challenge: 30

## Challenge Title
Hashtable and methods

<!-- ## Whiteboard Process -->

## Approach & Efficiency

create a hastable which accepts keys and values and appends it to the hashtable

## Solution

### after defining the initial code:
hashing:

    the Time Complexity is = O(n)
    the Space Complexity is = O(1)

set_new_key_and_value:

    the Time Complexity is = O(n)
    the Space Complexity is = O(n)

keys_items:

    the Time Complexity is = O(n)
    the Space Complexity is = O(n)

keys:

    the Time Complexity is = O(n)
    the Space Complexity is = O(n)

get:

    the Time Complexity is = O(n)
    the Space Complexity is = O(n)

has:

    the Time Complexity is = O(n)
    the Space Complexity is = O(n)

update_item:

    the Time Complexity is = O(n)
    the Space Complexity is = O(n)
