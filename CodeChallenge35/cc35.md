# Code challenge: 35

## Challenge Title
Graph implementation

## Whiteboard Process
<!-- ![alt text](./Whiteboard35.jpg) -->

## Approach & Efficiency

create a graph class with 5 methods add nodes, add edge, get nodes, get neighbors, get size

## Solution

### after defining the initial code:
add:
    the Time Complexity is = O(1)
    the Space Complexity is = O(1)

add edge:
    the Time Complexity is = O(n)
    the Space Complexity is = O(n+m)

get nodes:
    the Time Complexity is = O(n)
    the Space Complexity is = O(n)

get neighbors:
    the Time Complexity is = O(n+m)
    the Space Complexity is = O(1)

get size: 
    the Time Complexity is = O(1)
    the Space Complexity is = O(1)
