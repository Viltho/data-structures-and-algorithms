## Whiteboard Process
![alt text](./Whiteboard33.jpg)

## Approach & Efficiency

create a hastable function that is similar to the hashmap and to merge two hashmaps into one data structure of choice

## Solution

### after defining the initial code:
hashmap_left_join:

    the Time Complexity is = O(n)
    the Space Complexity is = O(n)
