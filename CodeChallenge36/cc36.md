# Code challenge: 36

## Challenge Title
Graph breadth first

## Whiteboard Process
![alt text](./Whiteboard36.jpg)

## Approach & Efficiency

create and return a list of traversal breadth first order of the graph

## Solution

### after defining the initial code:
breadth_first_graph:

    the Time Complexity is = O(n+m)
    the Space Complexity is = O(n)
